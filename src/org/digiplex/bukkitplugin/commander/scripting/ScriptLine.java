/**
 * TODO: make script lines abstract, and have a method that will make the line based on what it parses:
 *  if the line begins with [ then it is a construct:
 *     [if @var = literal] = if construct: if a variable equals something
 *     [!if @var = literal] = not if construct: if a variable is not equal to something
 *     [for @var in supportedCollection] = for each construct: for each in a supported collection (players, online players)
 *     [has "permission"] = has construct: if the current sender has the specified permission
 *     [!has "permission"] = has not contruct: if the current sender does not have the specified permission
 *     [switch @var] and [case #] = switch, on the variable
 *     [random # to #] and [case #] = same as switch, but with a random number 
 *  if the line begins with a @ then it is a variable assignment:
 *     @var = a number, string, or supported object with a name
 *  if the line begins with a ? then it is a scripting environment directive
 *     ?echo on/off = turns on/off echoing back messages from commands - the built-in echo command ignores it
 *  if the line begins with "say", 
 *  else:
 *     the line is a normal command to be executed by the current CommandSender, or mod if it begins with "sudo"
